      "content": "Hi, I have several questions that are related, so I will \npost them together, sorry if it's a lot. \n\n1. When I send a transaction, it enters the \"pending\" stage. \nAccording to https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/o1js-reference/type-aliases/TransactionStatus, it becomes \"included\" once it is included\nin a block that is part of the longest chain - does this mean \nthere has to be another block after this one? Does that mean \na transaction interacting with the deployed contract can first\nappear in the block after the deployment transaction or in the\nsecond one after it?\n\n2. From my understanding, when creating a zkApp that I need to\ninitialise, I need to wait for the deployment transaction to first\nbe \"included\" is this correct? \n\n3. If so, from my understanding, an \"included\" transaction is still \nnot 100% final, what happens if I create another transaction that \ninteracts with the zkApp created, but whose deployment transaction \nhas ultimately been rejected?\n\n4. I would also like to ask whether there exists a table similar \nto https://docs.minaprotocol.com/mina-protocol/lifecycle-of-a-payment, concerning the finality confidence after each block\nafter the one in which a transaction is included?\n\nWhat I am trying to do is create a graph to show how long it takes\nto deploy, initialise, and ultimately interact with a zkApp in terms\nof blocks and raw time, as well as in terms of setting the fees to \nmake this time shortest possible.",
