      "content": "Hey for my project NetZero which is a proof of solvency platform (under the navigators) I am implementing an ORAM based Sparse Merkle Tree as I will write the circuits in o1js all the code depends on o1js primitives like `Field`,`Group`and `Posidon.Hash` etc.\n\nFor performance reasons I am thinkning of writing this code in rust as all the other implementations (like summa by pse)  are in rust and it is not fair to benchmark rust vs js. Is there any way for me to port this o1js primitives in rust? \n\nAnother Idea I had was to serialize the params for circuits ( which are siblings nodes and few other commitment params) and deserialise it into the circuit types in js and then use the circuit but this also results in overhead cost of serializing and deserializing  and is a lot more work. If there any other way to do highly appreciated",
