      "content": "Assume each transaction has a global sequential number, so instead of validators we have miners competing for creating certain amount of proofs (could be dynamically adjusted as the difficulty in Bitcoin) for a block in a fixed amount of time. Then as soon as a miner produces the necessary amount of proofs, it shares the new state changes and the proof that backs these changes.\n\nThis could potentially:\n\n- Remove systemic risks that come from Proof of Stake like a stake majority being controlled by a few custodians or smart contracts.\n\n- Incentivize optimization of proof generation.\n\n- Decentralize proof generation.\n\n- Reduce the bandwidth necessary for consensus, since it only shares the final state and not the transactions themselves (this would also add some more privacy).\n\n- Allow people to get MINA without needing to buy it or receive it from someone else first (a modest but nice improvement on distribution and privacy)",

      "content": "- To be a large miner in PoW you may need a large physical installation but I would say that centralized exchanges, ETF custodians, Lido-like entities, etc, are far more powerful centralization forces in PoS, and things like Lido and Eigenlayer create dangerous systemic risks.\n\n- Generating zk proofs is closer to general computation so this kind of PoW would be less reliant on ASICs, leading to better hardware agnosticity and less dependency on specialized manufacturers.\n\n- Unlike custodians controlling the stake in PoS, mining pools don't control the hashrate directed to them, people can always redirect the hashrate to a new mining pool if the current ones misbehave. And we can implement things like P2Pool to decentralize mining pools further.\n\n- It's questionable saying that people can run PoS validators anonymously given that you first need to buy the stake, and Mina and most chains are transparent and we live in a KYC mass surveillance regime, so most funds can be tracked to a person, especially if they involve significant amounts of capital. And if we are using the argument of governments banning things, governments can also ban VPNs, running nodes, etc, with harsh punishments that will drop the number of participants significantly making it even easier to identify them. They can even establish a whitelist model at the ISP level where every connection not tied to an ID is automatically blocked (most major governments are actually pushing for this already), so I would say that we should fight those things at the political level more than at the technical level, or crypto will be completely defeated.\n\n- Security and robustness have a price, so I disagree that PoW is just a waste. Following your logic, all decentralized platforms are a waste and we shouldn't waste resources on security and robustness, and simply use more \"efficient\" centralized solutions.",

Banning VPN, running nodes etc is much less effective than simply confiscate big hardware.\n\nAnd even if the algorithms does not need specialized hardware, is inevitable that most of hashrate is centralized in a few miners, doesn't matter if it's asics or GPU. It's natural just like the centralization of capital and the ones who lives in countries with cheapest energy and hardware still with much more advantage.\n\nAnother point is that the PoS validator has much more incentive to be honest, since his capital is the network token itself and not hardware that could be used in other networks or for other purposes (like GPU).\n\nBut even if we were to agree that both PoW and PoS have major centralizing flaws, I would still opt for PoS because it is more efficient.",

      "content": "- You don't need huge mining farms for PoW to work tho. If enough people simply run a miner on commodity hardware at home, hashrate can add pretty quickly and we would avoid prover centralization which is one of the things PoW in Mina would be contributing to. This is also a far more anonymous way to get cryptocurrency by turning hardware and electricity into cryptocurrency without needing to buy it from someone.\n\n- If a majority stake is on the hands of institutions, they could refuse to vote in favor of blocks that include sanctioned addresses, effectively censoring those addresses, while in PoW eventually some miner can include those addresses in a block and mining pools can't do anything about it, since they don't vote on blocks. Similarly, once institutions control enough stake, they can guide the future of the protocol by endorsing specific hardforks and vote on blocks building on them.\n\n- Stake delegation is good but at the end a huge part of the stake will always be controlled by institutions due to centralized exchanges, ETFs, etc.\n\n- And protocols like Lido or Eigenlayer are really worrisome, since they pose systemic risks. Something going wrong with one of these protocols could trigger catastrophic failure all over the DeFi ecosystem and the consensus protocol.\n\nI don't feel super strongly about all of this and I think PoS may be good enough, but since Mina is all about decentralization and it already depends on PoW somewhat to create proofs, I think this is something worth considering.",
