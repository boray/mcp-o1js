      "content": "I am interested if it is possible to construct a Mina transaction and embed a circuit in it in a way that transaction becomes valid after proof of that circuit is provided.\n\nBased on the `o1js` examples and my own experience I can implement and deploy various smart contracts, they can implement custom logic, manage payments etc.\n\nHowever, sometimes a contract doesn't really need an on-chain component and deploying a contract is an unnecessary waste of resources. Here are few examples.\n\nExample 1: Atomic Swap.\nImagine I have a Circuit that can, given a trusted BTC block hash, list of consecutive blocks verify PoW and ensure a transaction has been made.\nI could create a Mina transaction that sends X amount of Mina in exchange of Y amount BTC, use the above circuit to verify if BTC transaction was made. I provide the transaction to the person who wishes to send BTC, this transaction would automatically become valid if the BTC transfer becomes valid. There is no need to deploy a smart contract and spend 1 Mina on account creation fee.\n\nExample 2: Puzzle Prize\nI construct some puzzle game and implement a Circuit that is capable of verifying the solution. I fund a prize of X Mina for a person who solves the puzzle. I construct a transaction for X Mina and leave the receiver blank. Then I publish the puzzle and the unfinished transaction on my website. Anyone who solves the puzzle can compile the Circuit and compute the proof, put own Mina address and make the transaction become valid, broadcast it to the network and claim the prize. In this example it would also be a waste to deploy a smart contract and spend 1 Mina account creation fee.\n\nMy question is, is it possible to make such conditional transactions? Is there some example for it?",
