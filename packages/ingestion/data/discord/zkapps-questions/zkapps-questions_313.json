We encountered some problems in the library and it pertains to kimchi/src/folding/examples.rs file where the use `ark_bn254` doesn't seem to work. We went through their git repo issues page, and it seems  something about upgrading ark-bn254, with having significant performance issues. We concluded that you are using some local binary of that ark-bn254. Can you confirm this? And if you have a workaround on this issue can you guide us.",
