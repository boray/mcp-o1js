      "content": "Good afternoon,\n\nAfter reading the documentation, exploring the discord logs, and studying existing (although limited) code samples on GitHub, one base concept is still not clear for me: the **token owner**.\n\nIs the token owner the smart contract where the token is defined, minted and burned, or is the public key that owns an amount of that token? Let's say we have the following scenario:\n\n1. [Me] Define token X, by deploying a Smart Contract on-chain\n2. [Me] mint 100 of token X to address A\n3. [Me] mint 100 of the token X to address B\n\nNow, let's say that the goal is to transfer 10 of token X from address A to address B. This transaction must be approved by the **token owner**. Who is the token owner in this scenario: is it the Smart Contract defining the token or the account A, because they own that token?\n\n\n**AccountUpdates And Custom Tokens**\n\nOn the same topic, I have a question regarding the concept of the \"Account\" on Mina. In the documentation it states that an Account is derived from the public key and a token id. Is it correct to understand that this is the case, because for something to be an \"account\", it must be able to have a balance, and since on Mina tokens are native, each public/private key pair can have multiple \"accounts\", one for each token. On Ethereum on the other hand, the account is the public/private keypair, as there is only of one thing that it can have a balance of at the protocol level (ETH).\n\nAdditionally, when we create AccountUpdates manually, it's necessary to specify the public key, alongside the token id. Is it correct to understand that this is needed soley for the part of sending tokens in the AccountUpdate, and that MINA is essentially a \"custom token with rules hardcoded in the protocol itself\"?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "> Is the token owner the smart contract where the token is defined, minted and burned, or is the public key that owns an amount of that token?\nIt's the zkApp account that the token is defined from, the first one described in this case. A custom token is defined as a combination of the zkApp account, and a tokenID. Each zkApp account has it's own custom token because it's derived from it's account and the existing MINA token is used as the tokenID. \n\n> Now, let's say that the goal is to transfer 10 of token X from address A to address B. This transaction must be approved by the token owner. Who is the token owner in this scenario: is it the Smart Contract defining the token or the account A, because they own that token?\nThe token owner in this scenario is the zkApp/SmartContract that defined the token, not the token holders themselves. They will need to reference the token owner zkApp and get approval to do any sort of operation since the token owner enforces the rules of it's own token (e.g. balance changes matching to 0). These details have a nice interface now with the new TokenContract class! https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1384",

This is why you must pay an account creation fee when interacting with custom tokens. I believe for ethereum, custom tokens are held within smart contracts, while in MINA the custom tokens are \"held\" by the keypair",
