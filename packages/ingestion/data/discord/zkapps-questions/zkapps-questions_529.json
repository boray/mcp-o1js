Blockchain Performance Challenges:\nSlow transaction processing times hindering widespread adoption.\nImpact on industries requiring high transaction volumes.\n\n2. The Blockchain Trilemma: Scalability, Decentralization, and Security:\nPersistent challenges regarding the trade-off between scalability, decentralization, and security.\n\n3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs as a Solution:\nZKPs offer a promising solution to simultaneously address scalability, decentralization, and security concerns.\n\n4. Practical Use Cases:\nApplication in scenarios like privacy-preserving financial verifications.\nCryptographic Potential of ZKPs:\nGaining attention for proving authenticity without disclosing information.\n\n5. Optimizing L2 Blockchains:\nFocused on optimizing Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, using ZK-Rollups.\n\n6. Broader Applicability Across Fields:\nPotential impact on various industries beyond blockchain.\n\nGuidelines for Conceptualization:\n\n- What problems can ZK solve?\n- What models can be used to help optimize Ethereum blockchain with Mina protocol (ZKPs)?\n- How can a simple MVP showcase this?\n\nRequirements:\n- Thesis must measure before and after optimization of models.\n- The thesis should work on optimizing the blockchain itself.\n- The data must allow bidirectional flow (data set in, and there must be an output).\n- Off-chain computation considerations?\n- Focus on optimizing on the blockchain.\n- Show metrics are crucial to prove the thesis's impact on optimizing scalability and throughput.",
