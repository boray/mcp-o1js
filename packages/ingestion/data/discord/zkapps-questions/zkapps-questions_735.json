Is there anything like TodoMVC in snarkyjs?\n\nOr if anyone can help guide me with my first project:  I'd like to build a little tracker that let's onelineforyourmind.com users track their path through, and then see if other users are on the same path (without revealing their path to anyone)  so basically just an array of urls for each user that keeps getting pushed.  (that's v1 at least, something simple)  I was thinking this might work neatly with a recursive circuit, but that's where my brain crashes!   The core function would tracking an array of strings per user, and returning the number of users currently matching the 0th index, 1st index and 2nd index..   I can see how a proof of visiting page can take a proof of a previous page as an input, but I can't see how that would produce a list of common users, in the same way that a database query would.   How would you structure this?",
