      "content": "I've been having a lot of issues trying to interact with a deployed contract.  Right now I've gone back to basics and am just trying to get tutorial 3 to work.  I deployed the \"Add\" contract and I'm able to 'get' state, however sending the transaction fails with an \"Insufficient Balance\" error, despite the fact that the account is funded.\n\nFrom looking through other posts, other people seem to have run into this problem, but their solutions weren't helpful/relevant (call 'fetch' on the account, or change the graphql endpoint).\n\nI'm using this endpoint:\n'https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql'\n\nI've attached a screenshot of the Auro wallet with the error.  What's really weird and seems like it could be the issue is that in the screenshot you can see the publicKey for the feePayer, and that is NOT the publicKey of my account.  However the tutorial code contains:\n\n`const publicKeyBase58: string = (await mina.requestAccounts())[0];\n const publicKey = PublicKey.fromBase58(publicKeyBase58);\n console.log(`Using key:${publicKey.toBase58()}`);`\n\nAnd this DOES print my correct account in the console.  So not sure what is going on here, any help would be appreciated.\n\nI've tried two other graphql endpoints, \n'https://api.minascan.io/node/berkeley/v1/graphql'\n'https://berkeley.graphql.minaexplorer.com/'\n\nAnd got different errors with both of those.",
